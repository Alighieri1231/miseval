Metric Parameter:
    The miseval eavluate function can be run with different metrics as backbone.
    You can pass the following options to the metric parameter:
    - String naming one of the metric labels, for example "DSC"
    - Directly passing a metric function, for example calc_DSC (from dice.py)
    - Passing a custom metric function

    List of metrics : See miseval/__init__.py under section "Access Functions to Metric Functions"

    The classes in a segmentation mask must be ongoing starting from 0 (integers from 0 to n_classes-1).

    A segmentation mask is allowed to have either no channel axis or just 1 (e.g. 512x512x1),
    which contains the annotation.
    The only exception from this is by activating the probabilities parameter, which results
    that a segmentation mask must have the same number of channels as n_classes (e.g. 512x512x8 if n_classes==8).
    Also the probabilities have to be in range between 0 to 1 and sum up to 1 (softmax).

Arguments:
    truth (NumPy Matrix):            Ground Truth segmentation mask.
    pred (NumPy Matrix):             Prediction segmentation mask.
    metric (String or Function):     Metric function. Either a function directly or encoded as String from miseval or a custom function.
    multi_class (Boolean):           Boolean parameter, if segmentation is a binary or multi-class problem. By default False -> Binary mode.
    n_classes (Integer):             Number of classes. By default 2 -> Binary
    probabilities (Boolean):         Boolean parameter, if predicted segmentation (pred) is encoded as softmax output.
                                     By default False -> normal class vector expected.

Output:
    score (Float) or scores (List of Float)

    The multi_class parameter defines the output of this function.
    If n_classes > 2, multi_class is automatically True.
    If multi_class == False & n_classes == 2, only a single score (float) is returned.
    If multi_class == True, multiple scores as a list are returned (for each class one score).
