The open-source Python library miseval is a metric library for evaluation of medical image segmentation.

**MIScnn provides several core features:**
- 2D/3D medical image segmentation for binary and multi-class problems
- Data I/O, preprocessing and data augmentation for biomedical images
- Patch-wise and full image analysis
- State-of-the-art deep learning model and metric library
- Intuitive and fast model utilization (training, prediction)
- Multiple automatic evaluation techniques (e.g. cross-validation)
- Custom model, data I/O, pre-/postprocessing and metric support
- Based on Keras with Tensorflow as backend
